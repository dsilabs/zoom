## How to contribute to Zoom

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Zoom**, and instead contact us at admin@dsilabs.com.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dsilabs/zoom/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dsilabs/zoom/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .py file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Zoom is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and help out!

Thanks!
